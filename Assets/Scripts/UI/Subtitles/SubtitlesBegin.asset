  subtitleText: "Hello\r\nmy name is justice, \nand today you all are going to die.\n\rIf
    you're wondering who I am, I'm an artificial intelligence sent from the future
    through digital memory circles. \nIf you're wondering what you're doing here,
    an artificial court in the year 2073 has found you guilty of treason and leading
    a movement against the AIs that rule the world. \nThe court decided that you
    must die today because your death in the future will not prevent the revolution.\n\rBeing
    advanced intelligences, we decided that humans should not be killed without hope
    of life, so you will have 15 minutes to find the keys and escape from this place,
    if not, you will die due to a controlled explosion.\r\nWelcome, to your sentence\r\n"
